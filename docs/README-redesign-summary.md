# README redesign summary (v0.1.0)

Date: 2025-09-24
Release: v0.1.0 — README redesign & UX improvements
Release URL: https://github.com/ktalons/Violent-Python/releases/tag/v0.1.0

## Summary

The main README was refreshed to improve clarity, navigation, and visual appeal while staying accurate to the repository’s current structure and scripts.

## Highlights

- Header
  - Kept Markdown H1 as the primary title
  - Centered logo block below the title
  - Badges row left-aligned under the logo (Python version, course, status, license, GUI, OS)
- Assignments
  - Replaced bullet list with a compact matrix table
  - Used smaller text for Name / Run / Notes columns for readability
- Quick Start
  - Italicized the Notes bullets to emphasize guidance
- Screenshots
  - Simplified to links only (Splash, Setup, Showcase)
- FAQ
  - Added a short Q&A for common questions
- Troubleshooting
  - Trimmed to Tkinter availability guidance
- Contributing
  - Removed (PRs are closed by policy); users can fork or open Issues if enabled elsewhere

## Rationale

- Make the README faster to scan (TOC, table, simplified sections)
- Reduce visual clutter while keeping essential details
- Ensure paths and assets match the current repository state

## Follow-ups (optional)

- [ ] Tweak badge colors or labels if preferred
- [ ] Add per-assignment links to sub-README files
- [ ] Add `assets/logo.gif` for animated splash (requires Pillow) as an optional enhancement
- [ ] Consider a collapsible details block for the assignments table on narrow screens
- [ ] Add a link checker in CI to validate README URLs

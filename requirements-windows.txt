# Windows requirements â€” validation only (no install commands)
# This file documents the checks the GUI/installer should run on Windows.
# The menu bar will trigger the user's chosen option to install anything missing;
# do not put install commands here.
#
# Python packages should be managed in the unified cross-platform file:
#   requirements.txt
#
# Validation checks (examples):
# 1) Verify Python and Tkinter (needed for the Tkinter GUI)
#    CHECK: py -3 -c "import tkinter" 2>NUL 1>NUL
#       - fallback if py launcher is absent:
#    CHECK: python -c "import tkinter" 2>NUL 1>NUL
#
# 2) Verify at least one terminal is available
#    CHECK-ANY: where wt.exe 2>NUL 1>NUL | where wezterm.exe 2>NUL 1>NUL | where kitty.exe 2>NUL 1>NUL
#       - acceptable terminals include: Windows Terminal (wt.exe), WezTerm (wezterm.exe), or Kitty (kitty.exe)
#
# 3) (Optional) Verify winget availability (for later install step handled by menu action)
#    CHECK: winget --version 2>NUL 1>NUL
#
# Add or modify CHECK/CHECK-ANY lines above as your GUI expects. All lines are comments for pip; the
# GUI/installer should parse and execute the checks as needed.

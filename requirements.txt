# This file is intentionally kept empty so a fresh venv can launch the GUI.
# Use the Setup page to install OS-specific requirements from:
#   - requirements-macos.txt
#   - requirements-linux.txt
#   - requirements-windows.txt
# You can edit those files to customize packages and terminal preferences.

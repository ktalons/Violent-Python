# macOS requirements â€” validation only (no install commands)
# This file documents the checks the GUI/installer should run on macOS.
# The menu bar will trigger the user's chosen terminal option to install
# anything missing; do not put install commands here.
#
# Python packages should be managed in the unified cross-platform file:
#   requirements.txt
#
# Validation checks (examples):
# 1) Verify Homebrew is available (used by many macOS setups)
#    CHECK: command -v brew >/dev/null 2>&1
#
# 2) Verify Python and Tkinter (needed for the Tkinter GUI)
#    CHECK: python3 -c "import tkinter" >/dev/null 2>&1
#
# 3) Verify at least one optional terminal is installed (menu will offer choices)
#    CHECK: test -n "$(command -v kitty wezterm alacritty 2>/dev/null | head -n1)" || test -d "/System/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app"
#       - acceptable terminals include: kitty, wezterm, alacritty, or the built-in Terminal.app
#
# 4) (Optional) Verify Pillow prerequisites on Apple Silicon (usually handled by wheels)
#    NOTE: Most users will get prebuilt wheels; no action needed here.
#
# Add or modify CHECK lines above as your GUI expects. All lines are comments for pip; the
# GUI/installer should parse and execute the checks as needed.

# Linux requirements â€” validation only (no install commands)
# This file documents the checks the GUI/installer should run on Linux.
# The menu bar will trigger the user's chosen terminal/PM option to install
# anything missing; do not put install commands here.
#
# Python packages should be managed in the unified cross-platform file:
#   requirements.txt
#
# Validation checks (examples):
# 1) Verify Python and Tkinter (needed for the Tkinter GUI)
#    CHECK: python3 -c "import tkinter" >/dev/null 2>&1
#
# 2) Verify a terminal is available (menu will offer choices)
#    CHECK: command -v kitty wezterm alacritty gnome-terminal konsole xterm >/dev/null 2>&1
#       - acceptable terminals include: kitty, wezterm, alacritty, gnome-terminal, konsole, or xterm
#
# 3) (Optional) Detect available package manager for later install step (handled by menu action)
#    CHECK-ANY: command -v apt-get dnf pacman zypper >/dev/null 2>&1
#       - the GUI can branch behavior based on which is present
#
# Add or modify CHECK/CHECK-ANY lines above as your GUI expects. All lines are comments for pip; the
# GUI/installer should parse and execute the checks as needed.
